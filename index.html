    <h1>Landscaping Project</h1>
    <p>
        I had a project where I had to tear apart someone's yard for renovation.
        I loved this job because it taught me work that I could apply into my future
        house! I tore a clients yard apart and reconstructed it with new materials
        such as soil, plants, rocks, vases etc... This job has taught me a lot about 
        measurements a lot so I don't use bad measurements in the future to make sure 
        everything is stable and laying correctly so the material does not deterriorate.
        This job has also taught me to exceed the clients expectations to go above and 
        beyond and has taught me great customer service. This job also gives you ideas of
        your own that you can use for future reference and helps you build different ideas 
        for different clients. This landscaping project has brought so much joy and entertainment.
